Youhuan Li is currently an associate professor in [College of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering](https://csee.hnu.edu.cn/people/liyouhuan), [Hunan University](https://www.hnu.edu.cn/). 
He worked as a postdoc in Tencent and [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn) (2018~2021).
He received Ph.D. from Wangxuan Institute of Computer Technology, Peking Universiy in 2018, advised by [Prof. Dongyao Zhao](https://www.wict.pku.edu.cn/zhaodongyan/en/) and [Prof. Lei Zou](https://www.wict.pku.edu.cn/zoulei/).
He was a visiting student in Database System Group in University of Waterloo (2016~2017), working with [Prof. Tamer Ozsu](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~tozsu/).
He received B.S. from School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn) in 2013.

Research Interests
======
Youhuan Li recently focus on LLM-driven data management and analysis. 
More specifically, he is committed to bridging the gap between database usage and ordinary people, enabling the design, deployment, creation, and query management of databases through natural language aloneâ€”without requiring specialized computer or database expertise.
